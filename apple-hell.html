That is, for the 2014 Macbook Pro, you first install Mavericks, and then upgrade to the latest system. That was interesting, since you can&#x27;t downgrade your system later; and also, you can&#x27;t upgrade to any system other than the latest. So if you are in this situation, you have Mavericks hardware, you lost your backup, and you need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_El_Capitan">El Capitain</a> instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Catalina">Catalina</a>; I&#x27;m not sure if you can do that.</p><p>There is a list of exceptions/rules under <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904">macOS Recovery exceptions</a> that will determine which version you can install depending on your hardware and last installed version. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/309400/58703"><em>simply</em> install a particular version of macOS</a>.</p><p>Mavericks was a bit of fresh air, though. It was pretty fast, and it didn&#x27;t have useless features that I didn&#x27;t need. But then, I stumbled upon another problem: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">Backward compatibility</a>. If you have been upgrading your macOS system consistently, you might have missed that Apple is a bad steward of backward compatibility; with probably the one exception of no longer supporting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/apple-prepares-macos-users-for-discontinuation-of-32-bit-app-support/">32-bit applications</a> which should have broke most of your games.</p><p>These are things that you can turn a blind eye on until they come later and bite you hard. For Mavericks, it didn&#x27;t have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop#Transfer_between_a_Mac_and_an_iOS_device">interoperable Airdrop</a> with iOS. So I wasn&#x27;t able to upload photos from my iPhone to the laptop. Maybe I should use Bluetooth? Tough luck, the iPhone doesn&#x27;t support <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/ar7yd4/sending_photo_from_iphone_to_android_with/">sending a photo</a> over Bluetooth. Once you leave Apple walled garden, you are pretty much screwed.</p><p>Needless to say, I was not able to get lots of applications running like Skype, RescueTime, Fork. They all require the latest version of macOS and do not support older versions.</p><h1 id="moving-forward"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="/apple-hell#moving-forward"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Moving forward</h1><p>I started having headaches with macOS last year. The Parental Control feature checks every URL you ping, and thus slowed down even local development which took me a week to figure out what process what slowing traffic. With macOS slowly diverging from a developer friendly OS to a mainstream, iPhone-like one, it&#x27;s time to move on. Here is what the next update of macOS will look like.</p><p><a href="/static/images/blog/apple-hell/dc5LRFprRqK1kpdQEptrWE0xspap.jpg"><img alt="macOS Big Sur" src="/static/images/blog/apple-hell/dc5LRFprRqK1kpdQEptrWE0xspap.jpg"/></a></p><blockquote><p>The new macOS is looking more like iOS</p></blockquote><p>I can understand Apple&#x27;s perspective; after all, a mainstream market is larger and more profitable than a developer&#x27;s only market. Creative people will still use Apple products regardless and people developing for macOS/iOS will always depend on the Apple ecosystem. So it might workout profitably for them.</p><p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, macOS is still a very good OS. I&#x27;ll probably keep using it in combination to the phone to do regular browsing, mail, documents and other miscellaneous stuff; probably pick an Air instead of a Pro.</p><p>For development, I took the plunge and built a box and installed <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a>. An <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-3700x">AMD Ryzen 3700X</a>, 32 GB of RAM, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-me/geforce/graphics-cards/gtx-1650-super/">Nvidia GTX 1650 Super</a> and an 256 GB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express">NVMe drive</a> cost roughly $1.000. Not that far from the cost of repairing a Macbook battery!</p><p>I was surprised how easy it is to setup ArchLinux on a randomly picked box; most of the hardware just worked out of the box; but it&#x27;s still early to judge the experience as I&#x27;m only two months in.</p><p>But that&#x27;s a talking point for another day!</p></div></div><div class="text-sm font-medium leading-5 xl:col-start-1 xl:row-start-2"><dl class="space-y-10 py-4"><div><dt class="sr-only">Published on</dt><dd class="text-s font-medium leading-6 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"><time dateTime="2020-08-18T00:00:00.000Z">Tuesday, August 18, 2020</time></dd></div></dl><div class="py-4"><h2 class="text-xs uppercase tracking-wide text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Tags</h2><div class="flex flex-wrap"><a class="mr-3 text-sm font-medium uppercase text-primary-500 hover:text-primary-600 dark:hover:text-primary-400" href="/tags/apple">Apple</a><a class="mr-3 text-sm font-medium uppercase text-primary-500 hover:text-primary-600 dark:hover:text-primary-400" href="/tags/review">Review</a></div></div><div class="flex justify-between py-4 xl:block xl:space-y-8"><div><h2 class="text-xs uppercase tracking-wide text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Previous Article</h2><div class="text-primary-500 hover:text-primary-600 dark:hover:text-primary-400"><a href="/usd-stable-coins">Examining the complex web of USD stable coins</a></div></div><div><h2 class="text-xs uppercase tracking-wide text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Next Article</h2><div class="text-primary-500 hover:text-primary-600 dark:hover:text-primary-400"><a href="/zero-rates-world">Are we in a bubble?
